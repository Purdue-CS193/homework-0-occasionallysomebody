# Ann's First CS193 Homework
## Some of my favorite things about CS193...
- **The slide decks be eaaaaatttttin'!**: simplistic, color-coordinated, and entertaining
- **Sense of community**: coding alone can be boring; coding alongside a class is more fun
- **Relatable instructors**: instructors are also students so there are less communication/cultural barriers
